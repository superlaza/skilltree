install node
install globally: gulp, coffee

Notes:
	I wanted to use mithril instead of react because of how lightweight it was, but ultimately react's monstrous support won me over

	Similarly, I considered switching to ES6 and transpiling using babel to ES5, instead of using coffeescript, because I thought it might future proof the app. I opted instead for coffeescript because I'd miss the syntax sugars too much.
